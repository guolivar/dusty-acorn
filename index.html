<p>tl;dr ... Acronym for Dusty Air Corner. Hardware/software project to bring air quality closer to pre-schoolers.</p>

<p>Air quality is often portrayed as a difficult subject where only specialists are able to participate in the discussion. However, we all breath the same air and therefore we all have a stake in understanding why the quality of the air changes and what can we do to mitigate adverse changes.</p>

<p>The main objective of this project is to develop an interactive display of air quality data accessible to pre-schoolers. The heart of the system is based on the Particles, Activity and Context Monitoring Autonomous Node (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/guolivar/pacman/wiki/Home">PACMAN</a>) that connects to a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> to translate the readings of CO, CO2, Dust, Temperature, Movement and proximity into a colourful display that encourages the children to explore different activities and their impact on the <em>invisible components</em> of the air.</p>

<p>In 2015 the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) started a pilot called <a href="http://www.curiousminds.nz/discover/article/4/38/participatory-science-platform"><em>Participatory Science Platform</em></a>. This is  a programme designed to integrate three key action areas in the National Strategic Plan for Science in Society, ‘A Nation of Curious Minds - He Whenua Hiriri I Te Mahara’ by engaging young people, communities and scientists in collaborative science projects.</p>

<p>One of the pilot regions is South Auckland where <a href="http://www.cometauckland.org.nz/">COMET Auckland</a> manages the <strong>SouthSci</strong> programme. One of the projects within this programme is where <strong>dusty-acorn</strong> sits.</p>

<p>The main participants in this project are five early childhood education centres in Mangere and NIWA's air quality team.</p>
